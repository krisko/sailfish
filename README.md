# Sailfish OS
# jolla-notes cli wrapper

**Features:**
* add and list notes (with colors)
* delete notes
* move notes
* change note color
* use color picker to pick custom color (in my case it's kcolorchooser)

**What does not work:**
* you cannot add multiline notes, only oneliners at the moment
* removing multiple notes at once is not implemented
* color printing works only with colors listed in help (can be extended)
